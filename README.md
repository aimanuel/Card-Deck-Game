# Card Deck game plan

* Create a deck of cards. 
* Shuffle the cards. 
* Pick 10 cards at random. 
* Show selected and remaining cards in the deck. 
* Repeat a couple of times 
* Dump the results to a database of your choice (in-memory welcome)
> If using in-memory DB, demonstrate that its working as expected.
* Also dump the same results to a CSV file.
* On the next run: 
> Read the saved results (if exists) from your CSV file. 
> Display previous results.
* The name of the card must be displayed using its "long name" version (e.g. 7 of spades) but stored (both csv and database) using its "short name" version (e.g. 7 SP). 
* There are no restrictions on the formatting of card names. You can use whatever convention you want for the “long name” and “short name”.
